Overview

This is a game based on Papa's pizzeria. It features 4 tabs that you can switch between: Cashier, Assembly, Baking,
and Slicing. In the Cashier tab you can view customers and their orders. In the Assembly tab, you can create a new pizza
and decorate it with 2 types of sauces, cheese, and 8 toppings. The 7 original papa's pizzeria game's toppings
are present and pineapple was a new personal addition. While on this tab, you can add and select toppings to
move them around or delete them. These actions can be undone and redone. The sauces can be be drawn onto the pizza using
mouse drag, but can only be deleted with the clear button, since it is not a topping and cannot be selected to be
deleted. The clear button will delete ALL toppings and sauces on the pizza. This action cannot be undone.

When you finish decorating the pizza, you can transfer the pizza onto the Baking tab by adding it to an oven. Once in
the oven, the pizza can be baked and then burnt. You can click on the pizza to take it out of the oven after it has been
added. There are four ovens, and pizzas can be added to them in any order. If you have multiple pizzas baking, the order
in which you take them out of the oven will determine the order they will be sliced in the Slicing tab.

To slice the pizza, you must click around the pizza within its tray. Each press will create one slice. After you finish
slicing, the pizza will appear in a pizza inventory in the Cashier tab. You can then select the pizza and either delete
it or serve it to a customer by pressing on the customer after the pizza is selected. The customer will give you a score
based on how accurate it is to their order. Deductions to your score will be made if you add extra toppings or
burn/under-bake the pizza. After scoring, the customer will give you a tip based on their satisfaction, and leave and be
replaced by the next customer. Customers that spawn will have a timer that indicates how long they will wait. Once
the timer runs out, they will leave and give a score of 0.

As you progress in the game, your performance will affect the game difficulty. The difficulty will increase or decrease
based on the last score you receive. Increasing the difficulty means more chances of spawning special customers with
either a nice, mean, or eccentric personality. Nice customers will wait longer and give bigger tips, mean customers
will order more, wait less, and give small tips, while eccentric customers will order more, wait longer, and give big
tips,
